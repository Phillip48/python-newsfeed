# python-newsfeed

## Description 
In this course, you’ll use Python to refactor an existing application that was originally built using Node.js. The app, called Just Tech News, is a website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. Instead of using Node.js as the back-end language and Handlebars.js as the templating engine, you’ll use Python to create the app and the Python Flask framework to create the application’s views.

## Notes
### Starting the Flask server and activating the virtual environment
* You'll know that you activated the virtual environment if (venv) appears at the command-line prompt. To actiavte it run the following command from the root directory of your project: .\venv\Scripts\activate  
* To deactivate the virtual environment, run the: deactivate :command from any directory.
* To start the Flask server: python -m flask run  
* The server runs at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Other Notes
* The __init__.py file of a Python package corresponds to the index.js file of a Node.js module.
* Other notes will be found in the code
